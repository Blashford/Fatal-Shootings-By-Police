## Liklihood of Fatal Police Shootings
We'll be using data gathered by The Washington Post on fatal police shootings between 2015 and 2020, as well as census data for each city in the US.

With this dataset, we want to know what, if any, factors play into the risk of police fatally shooting suspects. These factors include which state and city the shooting occured in, which we can break down into median household income, highschool education, percent below poverty, racial demographics for each city. We will also look at the individuals who lost their lives, their age, race, whether or not they were fleeing, if they were armed, and if they were exhibiting signs of mental illness.

### Method
In order to answer this question we will be utilizing Machine Learning with both supervised and unsupervised models to determine if these events can be predicted, and we will utilize both Python Pandas and Tableau in order to provide further analysis on the data.
