## Liklihood of Fatal Police Shootings
One way to define a city's risk of fatal police shootings would simply be to look at the number of occurences. However, various demographic factors such as poverty, education, and race may also have an impact on a city's liklihood to have a fatal police shooting. We would like to investigate if there is a significant difference between these two methods of calculating risk.

### Method
We'll be using data gathered by The Washington Post on fatal police shootings between 2015 and 2020, as well as census data on median household income, highschool education, percent below poverty, and racial demographics to address this question.
